	\section{Project Overview}
	
	IUT-Medical Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline operations and enhance patient care within the Islamic University of Technology's medical center. It offers features such as appointment scheduling, medical expense management, room reservations, prescription generation for doctors, and availability tracking for doctors.
	
	
	
	\section{Motivation behind the Project}
	
	The motivation behind IUT Medical Center Digital Platform project stems from a commitment to modernize and optimize healthcare delivery at the Islamic University of Technology's medical center. Recognizing the evolving landscape of healthcare technology and the increasing demand for streamlined patient services, this project aims to address key challenges faced by both patients and healthcare providers. By implementing a comprehensive digital solution, we seek to enhance accessibility, convenience, and efficiency in accessing medical care while also improving operational workflows and resource management within the medical center. Through this initiative, we aspire to elevate the overall patient experience, foster stronger doctor-patient relationships, and ultimately contribute to the delivery of high-quality healthcare services that meet the evolving needs of our community.

	\section{Key Features}
	
	
	\subsection{Appointment Scheduler}
	
	Patients can conveniently book appointments with healthcare providers through an intuitive online calender. The system provides real-time availability of doctors, allowing patients to select preferred time slots based on their convenience.
	
	
	\subsection{Service Reservations}
	
	Patients can reserve rooms or bed or other available services through the platform. Hospital staff can also efficiently manage reservations and services for patients.
	
	
	\subsection{Generate Prescription}
	
	Healthcare providers can generate digital prescriptions for patients directly within the platform.
	
	\subsection{Provide and Apply for Referrals}
	Students can apply for referrals through the platform and doctors can respond to them and provide referrals for external medical services.
	
	
	\subsection{Manage Medical Records}
	This feature empowers doctors and nurses to efficiently manage and update medical records for patients under their care within the IUT Medical Center Digital Platform. It provides nurses with secure access to patient information, streamlining documentation processes and ensuring accurate and up-to-date medical records.
	
	
	\subsection{Staff Scheduler}
	This feature enables efficient scheduling and management of healthcare staff within the IUT Medical Center. It provides administrators with tools to create, view, and adjust staff schedules, ensuring adequate coverage and optimal resource allocation across various departments and shifts.
	
	
	\subsection{Due Medical Expense Management}
	
	The Due Medical Expense Management feature enables students with referrals to submit medical bills incurred outside IUT for reimbursement. Students upload referral documents, prescriptions, and bills for administrative verification. Once verified, administrators clear dues. This feature serves students and admins, updating due trackers in student profiles for transparency.
