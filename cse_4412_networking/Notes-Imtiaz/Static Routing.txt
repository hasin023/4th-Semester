Static Routing
===========================
1. Make the Topology
2. In all 1941 Routers, add a HWIC-2T port.
3. Wiring:
	PC to Switch: copper straigth(fa-fa)
	Switch to Router: copper straigth(fa-gig)
	Router to Router: Serial DCE (se-se)
4. In Router 1:
(router1 to switch1)
# int g0/0
# ip address (deafult gateway) (subnet mask)
# desc connection-to-pc3
# no shutdown
# exit
(router1 to router2)
# int s0/1/0
# ip address (default gateway) (subnet mask)
# desc connection-to-r2
# clock rate 64000
# no shutdown
# exit
(router1 to router3)
# int s0/1/1
# ip address (default gateway) (subnet mask)
# desc connection-to-r3
# clock rate 64000
# no shutdown
# exit
 
5. In Router 2:
(router2 to router1)
# int s0/1/1
# ip address (default gateway) (subnet mask)
# desc connection-to-r1
# clock rate 64000
# no shutdown
# exit
(router2 to switch2)
# int g0/0
# ip address (default gateway) (subnet mask)
# desc connection-to-switch2
# no shutdown
# exit

6. In Router 3:
(router3 to router1)
# int s0/1/1
# ip address (default gateway) (subnet mask)
# desc connection-to-r1
# clock rate 64000
# no shutdown
# exit
(router3 to switch2)
# int g0/0
# ip address (default gateway) (subnet mask)
# desc connection-to-switch2
# no shutdown
# exit


7. Router1 (Next hop config):
	- Go to config
	- Routing > Static
	- Network: (destination network)
	  Mask: (255.255.255.0/subnet mask)
	  Next Hop: (r2 default gateway)
		- Add
	- Network: (destination network)
	  Mask: (255.255.255.0/subnet mask)
	  Next Hop: (r3 default gateway)
		- Add
	
8. Router2 (Next hop config)
